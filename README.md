My submission for the November, Week 4 CodePen challenge

This is my submission for the November Week 4 Codepend challenge. Here is the challenge description:

"This week, we'll wrap up the text styles theme with a deceptively simple challenge: book text.
Our template this week includes the markup for a brief excerpt from Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway". 
All you have to work with are a few headings and lots of paragraphs. 
That's what makes this a real challenge! How do you take this big wall of plain text and make it both legible and eye-catching?"


I created some Art-Deco style borders, added colour scheme, made the header resize on scroll, and added a toggle button for day and night mode, reformatted the text and picked some 1920's style fonts.
